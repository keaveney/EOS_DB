This is a d3.js tree diagram that incldes an interactive element and loads the json data from an external file.

Any parent node can be clicked on to collapse the portion of the tree below it, on itself. Conversly, it can be clicked on again to regrow.

It is derived from the Mike Bostock [Collapsible tree example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083) and updated to use v4.
